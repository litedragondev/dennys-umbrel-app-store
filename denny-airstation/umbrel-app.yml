  📻 Airstation is an open-source, self-hosted web application designed to allow users to create and manage their own online radio station. It provides an intuitive and minimalist interface for streaming music over the internet, making it easy for anyone to broadcast their favorite tracks to listeners worldwide. The platform enables users to upload audio files, organize playlists, and control playback through a simple web-based player that listeners can access from any device.


  Technically, Airstation leverages HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) to deliver smooth and reliable music streaming. It utilizes FFmpeg to handle audio processing tasks such as format conversion and streaming optimization. Metadata and playlist information are stored in a lightweight SQLite database, ensuring that the system remains efficient and easy to maintain. To simplify deployment, Airstation is packaged as a Docker container, allowing it to run seamlessly on various platforms including Raspberry Pi, Synology NAS devices, and traditional servers.


  The project is released under the MIT license, offering users freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software without restriction. Airstation is particularly appealing to those who want to run a personalized internet radio station without relying on third-party services, providing full control over their music streaming experience. With clear documentation and an active repository, it supports enthusiasts looking for a straightforward yet powerful solution to host their own online radio broadcasts.


  ⚙️ The app is accessible at umbrel.local:7331/studio. After entering the password, you reach the studio interface where you can add music. Once done, you can remove "/studio" from the URL to access the main interface for sharing your music.
