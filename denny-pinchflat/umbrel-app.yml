  📥 Pinchflat is a self-hosted application designed for automated downloading and management of YouTube content. It is built using the Elixir programming language and leverages the Phoenix web framework to provide a user-friendly interface. The application utilizes yt-dlp, a powerful tool for downloading videos from YouTube and other platforms, allowing users to regularly download videos from selected YouTube channels or playlists and incorporate them into their personal media libraries.


  The core functionality of Pinchflat revolves around automation. It continuously monitors specified YouTube channels or playlists for new content and downloads these videos without manual intervention. This makes it an ideal solution for users who want to maintain an up-to-date collection of their favorite online media. The downloaded videos can be seamlessly integrated with popular media center software such as Plex, Jellyfin, or Kodi, enabling users to organize and enjoy their content in a familiar environment.


  Pinchflat offers customization options that let users define specific rules for managing downloads. This includes handling various types of content like YouTube Shorts and live streams. Additionally, the software supports notifications through Apprise, so users can be alerted when new content is available or when downloads have completed.


  One of the notable features of Pinchflat is the ability to periodically redownload content. This is useful for situations where the quality of a video might improve over time or when additional metadata such as SponsorBlock tags become available. Furthermore, the application can automatically delete older content after a specified period, helping users manage storage space efficiently.


  The backend of Pinchflat relies on SQLite for storing metadata about the downloaded videos. The frontend focuses on server-side rendered HTML enhanced with minimal JavaScript through Alpine.js, ensuring a responsive and straightforward user experience without unnecessary complexity.


  Overall, Pinchflat serves as a powerful tool for anyone looking to automate the retrieval and management of YouTube content. Its integration capabilities, automation features, and user-friendly design provide a comprehensive solution for creating a personal media library sourced from online videos.
