  Spooty is a self-hosted application designed to download music using Spotify URLs. It functions by extracting metadata such as song titles, artists, and album information from Spotify and then locating the corresponding audio content on YouTube, where it downloads the audio files. The application is developed in TypeScript and is released under the MIT license, allowing users to freely modify and distribute it. Spooty also includes Docker support, enabling easy deployment across various environments. Additionally, it offers a feature to subscribe to playlists or artist pages, automatically downloading new releases as they become available. 
  
  
  ⚠️ While the tool provides convenient access to music, users should be aware of the potential legal implications of downloading copyrighted content without proper authorization.
