  Gotify is an open-source, self-hosted notification server designed to enable real-time push notifications across multiple devices. It is a lightweight, efficient system that allows applications to send messages to the Gotify server via a REST API. These messages are then delivered to connected clients, including web browsers, mobile devices, or other systems that support Gotify’s push notification service.


  The server is built with Go, known for its high performance and minimal resource consumption, making it suitable for various environments. Gotify’s simple and intuitive web interface allows users to manage notifications, configure applications, and generate API tokens for authentication and access control.


  One of the core features of Gotify is its support for real-time notifications using WebSockets. This allows connected clients to receive notifications instantly, ensuring timely delivery of messages. Additionally, Gotify supports categorizing and prioritizing notifications, helping users organize incoming messages based on importance.


  Gotify offers a native Android app, which allows users to receive push notifications directly on their devices. It also provides a web app, ensuring that users can stay updated across different platforms. The system’s architecture is designed for flexibility and scalability, enabling it to handle notifications from a variety of sources, from system alerts and monitoring tools to custom applications.


  As a self-hosted solution, Gotify gives users complete control over their notification infrastructure, ensuring privacy and data security. With its open-source nature, it can be customized and extended to suit different use cases. The ability to host notifications locally, without relying on third-party services, makes Gotify an attractive option for those seeking a private, cost-effective solution for delivering real-time notifications.
