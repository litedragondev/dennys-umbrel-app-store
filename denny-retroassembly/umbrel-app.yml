  👾 RetroAssembly is a platform designed to let users build and enjoy their own personal library of retro video games. It takes ROM files provided by the user and transforms them into a beautifully presented collection, complete with cover art and detailed information. The interface makes it easy to explore the library, search for specific titles, and rediscover forgotten classics in an engaging and organized way.


  Once a game is selected, it can be launched immediately, providing a seamless transition from browsing to playing. All progress is automatically saved, allowing players to return to their exact point in the game at any time. This persistence ensures that even long, challenging titles can be completed over multiple sessions without losing any achievements.


  The gameplay experience is enhanced by a variety of features that recreate the feel of original hardware while adding modern conveniences. Visual filters mimic the appearance of classic CRT and handheld screens, bringing an authentic atmosphere to each session. A rewind function allows players to reverse gameplay in real time, offering the chance to retry difficult sections without starting over completely. Save states provide another layer of control, letting users preserve specific points in a game for quick reloads.


  Navigation throughout the library and during gameplay is smooth and intuitive, with full support for both keyboard and controller input. Every element is designed to keep the focus on the games themselves, removing unnecessary distractions and making it simple to enjoy everything from quick sessions of arcade-style action to long adventures spanning many hours.
