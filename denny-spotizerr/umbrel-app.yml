  💿 Spotizerr is an open-source music downloader designed to allow users to download songs from Spotify and Deezer in lossless quality. It combines the vast music catalog of Spotify with the high audio fidelity provided by Deezer, offering a unique solution for music enthusiasts who want the best of both platforms.


  The application relies on the deezspot library and operates by first attempting to download tracks from Deezer. If the download fails, it automatically falls back to Spotify, ensuring a high success rate for retrieving music. Users can search for songs either by using the Spotify API directly or by entering Spotify URLs, making it easy to find specific tracks or playlists.


  Spotizerr supports managing multiple downloads simultaneously through a queue system, providing clear progress indicators during the download process. It also offers the ability to manage login credentials for both Spotify and Deezer in an integrated manner, which is necessary because Spotify now requires valid client credentials due to recent changes in their terms of service.


  One important consideration when using Spotizerr is security. The application stores login credentials in plaintext, so it is recommended to use it within a secure environment or to add additional layers of protection such as VPNs or authentication gateways when deploying it in open networks.


  Since its latest update, Spotizerr has adapted to Spotify's new requirements by integrating support for custom client ID and secret keys. The update also introduced configurable options for track numbering and retry mechanisms, enhancing the flexibility and reliability of the downloader.


  Spotizerr is licensed under GPL-3.0 and the full source code is available on GitHub, inviting developers and users to contribute or customize the tool according to their needs. Overall, it presents a powerful and flexible way to obtain high-quality music from popular streaming services with ease.
