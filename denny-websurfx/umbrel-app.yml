  🌐 Websurfx is an open source meta search engine designed to be self hosted, providing users with a private and customizable alternative to mainstream search services. Built using the Rust programming language, it emphasizes performance, security, and efficient resource management. This choice of technology helps ensure memory safety and fast execution while reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.


  The core idea behind Websurfx is to aggregate search results from multiple providers into a single, unified interface. By doing so, it avoids displaying ads and focuses on delivering organic and relevant search results. Websurfx features a built in ranking algorithm that reorganizes results to highlight the most pertinent information, creating a clean and distraction free search experience.


  Websurfx offers a highly customizable user interface with several pre made color schemes available out of the box. Users also have the option to create their own themes, allowing them to tailor the visual appearance according to their preferences. Additionally, the platform includes advanced filtering options that enable users to control the content they see, including the ability to filter out sensitive or not safe for work material.


  Performance is another key strength of Websurfx. It uses multiple caching layers to speed up repeated searches and reduce latency. For Linux users, it can leverage IO uring, a modern asynchronous I/O interface, to achieve even better responsiveness and resource efficiency. These technical optimizations make Websurfx a fast and reliable solution for everyday search needs.


  Beyond standard web search, Websurfx integrates various micro applications directly into the search results. These tools can include calculators, currency converters, and other utilities that enhance productivity without requiring users to leave the search page. The engine also supports enhanced image search capabilities, with filters for color and size, making it versatile for a wide range of use cases.


  Compared to similar meta search engines like SearX, Websurfx places strong emphasis on security and memory safety thanks to its Rust foundation. It also stands out with its clean design, customizable interface, and additional built in tools, catering to users who want a modern and privacy focused search experience.
