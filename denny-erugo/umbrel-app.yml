  ↗️ Erugo is a modern and elegant file sharing application designed to offer a smooth and secure experience when sending or receiving files. Unlike traditional cloud based services, Erugo puts simplicity and clarity at the center of its interface, allowing users to upload files and instantly generate clean, human readable share links that are easy to share and remember.


  One of the key features of Erugo is the ability to create upload requests. These allow users to invite others to send files back to them through a unique upload page, without requiring an account or any technical setup. This makes collaboration and file collection simple and efficient, whether for personal use or in professional environments.


  With its focus on user friendly design and practical functionality, Erugo stands as a privacy conscious alternative to mainstream file transfer platforms such as WeTransfer, Google Drive, Dropbox, and Send Anywhere. While these services often rely on centralized infrastructure and advertising based business models, Erugo offers a refreshing and focused experience by removing unnecessary complexity and distractions.


  The platform is ideal for anyone who needs a straightforward way to share files without navigating cluttered dashboards or being exposed to ads. Every element in Erugo, from its minimal interface to the clean structure of its shareable links, is crafted to make file sharing fast, reliable, and pleasant.


  By providing a simple and calm alternative to the big names in file transfer, Erugo redefines what file sharing can be. It delivers an experience that is clear, efficient, and truly enjoyable to use.
