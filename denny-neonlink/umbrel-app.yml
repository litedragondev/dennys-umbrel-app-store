  🔗 NeonLink is a self-hosted web application designed to give users complete control over how they collect, organize, and revisit their favorite web resources. It provides a clean, intuitive, and visually engaging interface that transforms a simple list of bookmarks into a personalized library of online content. Each link saved in NeonLink is automatically enriched with metadata such as the website title, a brief description, and its favicon, creating a polished and easily recognizable collection that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.


  The application allows users to apply tags to bookmarks, enabling precise categorization and filtering. This makes it effortless to group similar resources together or to quickly locate a specific link using the built-in search functionality. Whether you are managing a large archive of research material or a small set of frequently visited sites, the tagging and search tools make navigation smooth and efficient.


  NeonLink also offers a high degree of customization to suit individual tastes and workflows. Users can select or add their own background images to give the dashboard a distinct visual identity, turning it from a generic list into a space that feels personal and tailored. The organized layout presents bookmarks in a way that balances clarity and design, ensuring that the information you need is always easy to find.


  At its core, NeonLink is focused on privacy and autonomy. All bookmarks are stored under the user’s control, without reliance on third-party services, which ensures that personal browsing habits remain private. It is built for people who value both functionality and independence in managing their online resources, making it an elegant and secure solution for anyone seeking a better way to store and access the websites that matter most to them.
