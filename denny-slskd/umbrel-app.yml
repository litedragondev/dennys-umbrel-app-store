  slskd is a self-hosted client-server application designed for the Soulseek file-sharing network. It is implemented in C# and distributed under the AGPL-3.0 license. Unlike the traditional Soulseek client, slskd is structured as a daemon that can run on various platforms, including Linux, and provides a modern, web-based user interface accessible through a web browser. This approach allows users to interact with the Soulseek network without relying on the official client while maintaining the ability to search for, download, and share files.


  The primary goal of slskd is to offer a more flexible and accessible way to use Soulseek, especially for those who prefer or require a self-hosted solution. It leverages a token-based authentication system that integrates smoothly with reverse proxies, enhancing security and providing more control over access. Users can configure the application using a YAML configuration file, where they can input their Soulseek login credentials and adjust various settings to suit their preferences.


  One of the standout features of slskd is its comprehensive search functionality, allowing users to perform multiple simultaneous searches, filter results, and manage ongoing downloads through a single, centralized interface. The web interface is intuitive and designed to be responsive, making it easy to manage files from any device with a web browser.


  For those looking to extend or automate their interactions with slskd, there is a dedicated Python API called slskd-api. This API provides endpoints for interacting with the daemon programmatically, enabling developers to integrate Soulseek functionality into other applications or workflows.


  slskd also includes mechanisms for secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the interface. This makes it particularly suitable for multi-user setups or scenarios where the server is exposed to the internet through a reverse proxy.


  Overall, slskd represents a modernized approach to Soulseek, combining the familiar functionality of the original client with the scalability, security, and convenience of a self-hosted, web-based service.
