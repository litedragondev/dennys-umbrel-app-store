  👩‍💻 TaxHacker is an intelligent accounting application that simplifies the management of receipts, invoices and financial records through the use of artificial intelligence. It is designed to automatically analyze uploaded documents, extracting key details such as dates, amounts, taxes, currencies and vendors with high accuracy.


  The app combines advanced optical character recognition with AI-driven data interpretation, ensuring reliable parsing even for low-quality scans or documents in different languages. It can process a wide variety of currencies, including cryptocurrencies, and converts them using the historical exchange rate at the exact date of the transaction.


  All extracted data is presented in a structured format that makes it easy to search, filter and export. Users can create customized data fields, projects and categories, allowing the system to adapt to individual bookkeeping needs.


  By leveraging powerful AI models, TaxHacker offers intelligent categorization and context-aware data extraction that goes far beyond traditional invoice scanning. Its main objective is to minimize manual effort in financial administration and provide users with a precise, well-organized overview of their financial activities.
