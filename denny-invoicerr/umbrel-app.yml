  📊 Invoicerr is a modern open source web application designed specifically for freelancers and small business owners who need a simple yet powerful way to manage their quotes and invoices.


  It allows users to create professional PDF documents that comply with European tax and invoice regulations, making it especially suitable for users within the EU. These PDFs can include details such as VAT, banking information, and optional QR codes for convenient payment processing.


  With its clean and intuitive user interface, Invoicerr streamlines the process of tracking quotes, sending invoices, and monitoring their status from draft to paid. It also supports electronic signatures, giving clients the ability to accept quotes directly and securely.


  The application includes customizable design options and integrated email templates, enabling users to adapt the appearance and messaging of their invoices to match their personal or business branding. There is no unnecessary complexity or clutter, making it ideal for those who want to focus on their work rather than learning a complicated system.


  Invoicerr is particularly well-suited for tech-savvy individuals who value control, privacy, and simplicity in their financial workflows.
