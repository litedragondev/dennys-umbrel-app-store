  Fusion is a web application that functions as a personal feed reader, enabling users to collect, organize, and read content from a wide range of online sources that publish RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds. It is designed for individuals who prefer to consume news and updates from multiple websites in a centralized and distraction-free environment. Once set up, Fusion automatically fetches new entries from subscribed feeds at regular intervals and stores them in a local database, ensuring that content is always available and up to date.


  The application presents articles in a clean and responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It supports full-text previews, dark and light themes, and quick navigation using keyboard shortcuts, making it a convenient tool for frequent readers. Feeds can be organized into custom categories, and individual entries can be bookmarked for later reading. Fusion also includes a powerful search function that allows users to quickly locate articles based on keywords or phrases, even across large numbers of feed entries.


  Fusion respects user privacy by operating without tracking or relying on external services. It supports multilingual interfaces, including English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and others, making it accessible to a global audience. The application allows easy import and export of subscriptions using the widely supported OPML format, so users can migrate their reading lists from other feed readers or share them with others.


  Built with performance and simplicity in mind, Fusion uses a lightweight backend written in Go and stores its data in a SQLite database. It can be deployed effortlessly via Docker or as a standalone binary, and it requires minimal system resources. This makes it particularly well-suited for small servers, Raspberry Pi setups, or any environment that values efficiency and privacy. Fusion is an ideal solution for users who want complete control over their feed-reading experience without relying on third-party platforms.
